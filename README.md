# MadhavaPiCalculator
Iriññāttappiḷḷi Mādhavan Nampūtiri known as Mādhava of Sangamagrāma (c. 1340 – c. 1425) was a mathematician 
and astronomer from the town believed to be present-day Kallettumkara, Aloor Panchayath, Irinjalakuda in Thrissur 
District, Kerala, India. He is considered the founder of the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics. 
One of the greatest mathematician-astronomers of the Middle Ages, Madhava made pioneering contributions to the 
study of infinite series, calculus, trigonometry, geometry, and algebra. (source - Wikipedia)

In this program I implemented his more rapidly converging infinite series to calculate the value of Pi.

The reference value for Pi in the code is only to test how many terms of the series were needed for each decimal place calculated.
