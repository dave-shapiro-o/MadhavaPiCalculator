# MadhavaPiCalculator
Iriññāttappiḷḷi Mādhavan Nampūtiri known as Mādhava of Sangamagrāma (c. 1340 – c. 1425) was a mathematician 
and astronomer from the town believed to be present-day Kallettumkara, Aloor Panchayath, Irinjalakuda in Thrissur 
District, Kerala, India. He is considered the founder of the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics. 
One of the greatest mathematician-astronomers of the Middle Ages, Madhava made pioneering contributions to the 
study of infinite series, calculus, trigonometry, geometry, and algebra. (source - Wikipedia)

In this program I implemented his more rapidly converging infinite series to calculate the value of Pi.
